	</main>
	
	<p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>
	
	<h3>SO WHAT IS HTML??</h3>
	
	<p>HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.</p>
	
	<h3>ANATOMY OF HTML</h3>
	
	<img src = "htmlanatomy.png" height = "150px" width = "400px">
	
	<h5>The main parts are as follows : </h5>
	
	<ol>
		<li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
		<li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
		<li>The element: The opening tag, the closing tag and the content together comprise the element.</li>
		<li>The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
