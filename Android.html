	<h5>The anatomy of android is as follows : </h5>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Android Studio: This is used to organize the files and code that make up your app, or maybe you’re using another IDE like Eclipse.</li>
		<li>AndroidManifest.XML: This file contains a bunch of properties that you’ll need to set when you eventually deploy your app to the Play Store or on other phones. This is where stuff like the name of your app and its permissions gets set. </li>
		<li>Source Code: Android apps are written in Java and their source codes are stored in .java files. The .java files are stored in whatever package you chose when you created your app project. The entry point of an Android app is the main activity class.</li>
		<li>Resources: The resources directory contains non-code files that are needed to run your app. Stuff like images and property files go here.Some of its sub-directories are drawable,layout,mipmap,values</li>
